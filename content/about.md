Hi! I’m Sam Passmore. I’m a Postdoctoral researcher with Pat Savage's [CompMusic Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/comp-music-lab/home) (CompMusic is for comparative and computational approaches to the study of music) at Keio University in Japan. Previously, I was a PhD student and member of Fiona Jordan’s [VariKin](https://excd.org/research-activities/#varikin) project studying the evolution of kinship. 

I use quantitative methods to explore the cultural diversity seen around the globe. Currently, I am looking at musical diversity, and my PhD was on diversity in kinship terminology. Previously I studied and worked for Quentin Atkinson at the University of Auckland - the city where I grew up. Outside of academia, I have worked as a Data Scientist at [Pingar International](https://www.pingar.com/).

I am also big into programming with R, and have strong opinions on data management. 

If there’s something I can help with - don’t hesitate to contact me!
