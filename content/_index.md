Hi! I’m Sam Passmore

I use quantitative methods to explore the cultural diversity observed around the globe.

Currently, I’m a Research Fellow in the Evolution of Cultural Diversity Initiate, at the Australian National University, led by Nick Evans. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher with Pat Savage's [CompMusic Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/comp-music-lab/home) at Keio University in Japan (CompMusic is for comparative and computational approaches to the study of music). I finished my PhD in 2021 at the University of Bristol as a member of Fiona Jordan’s [VariKin](https://excd.org/research-activities/#varikin) project studying the evolution of kinship and kinship terminology (Varikin is for Variance in Kinship). Earlier in my career, I studied and worked for Quentin Atkinson at the University of Auckland - the city where I grew up. Outside of academia, I have worked as a Data Scientist at [Pingar International](https://www.pingar.com/).

I am big into programming with R, and have strong opinions on data management. 

If there’s something I can help with - don’t hesitate to contact me!
